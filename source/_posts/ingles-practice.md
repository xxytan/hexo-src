<h3 align="right">My Holiday Plans</h3>
&emsp;&emsp;How time flies! The winter holiday is getting closer and closer. To make my holiday more wonderful, I listed some plans. Let's have a change.

&emsp;&emsp;Rest is the first. When we were at school, study pressure were always suffocating. "Holiday doesn't come easily", I can release myself eventually! So I'm going to hang out with my friends, have some barbecues, and play video games. Also, homework is necessary. Something we learnt before we're going to forget if we do only play in the whole holiday. In order to avoid this situation, i'll also finish my homework meanwhile I enjoy myself and review often. Last but not least: do chores. My parent's won't stop working, although the holiday comes. So i will do chores that I'm able to do, such as sweeping and washing. I don't want to see them doing chores with a tired body

&emsp;&emsp;In a word, "Holiday can't cause life to stop". I'll balance my things. I'm looking forward to the coming winter holiday!
